  <h3 class="margin">About me</h3>
  <p>Hello everyone this is my personal website telling you a little about myself. This website looks pretty cool right? I created this bio website myself, one of many interest. At the moment I am a beginner at crafting websites but I plan on progressing and challenging myself to make more interactive webpages. Revisit this website in a few months and watch it evolve and become cooler as I advance. I am a New York native, and live in the Bronx. I am the youngest of five children, with three brothers and one sister. After graduating high school I took my talents to St. Johns University. Enjoying math and science I majored in physics, graduating with a bachelorâ€™s degree in physics. Job market being scarce in the field I decided to dabble in coding to become a full stack developer.  </p>
